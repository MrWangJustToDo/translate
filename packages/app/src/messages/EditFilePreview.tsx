/**
 * Renders the edit_file tool's input as a diff preview.
 *
 * Shows two layers:
 *  1. A full-file diff (original file → file after all edits applied).
 *  2. The per-edit fragment diffs (oldString → newString for each edit),
 *     which give a focused view of each individual change.
 *
 * The full-file content is sourced from two places depending on lifecycle:
 *  - After the tool executed (output-available): read `oldFile`/`newFile`
 *    directly from the tool output. This is authoritative and stays correct
 *    even if the file is later modified by other edits.
 *  - Before execution (approval phase): compute on the fly via `previewEdit`,
 *    which reads the current file and applies the edits in memory.
 *
 * When the full-file preview is unavailable (file not found, read error, etc.),
 * falls back to rendering each per-edit fragment as its own diff, using
 * oldString → newString as the before/after content with `startLine` for
 * proper line number alignment.
